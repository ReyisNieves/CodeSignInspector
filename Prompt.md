## 🛡️ CodeSignInspector: Cross-Platform Code Signing Validation & Reporting

**Prompt Title:** `CodeSignInspector` – Multi-Platform Code Signature Validator & Inspector

### 🎯 Objective

Create a **cross-platform desktop application** that allows users to analyze, validate, and report on **digital signatures (code signing)** across executable binaries and code artifacts. The solution will use:

* **Backend:** .NET 8 (C#) for all signature processing, file analysis, and system service interaction
* **Frontend:** Electron (JavaScript/TypeScript) as a thick client that interacts with the .NET backend via REST or gRPC
* **Platform Targets:** Windows, macOS, and Linux
* **Goal:** Help developers, security engineers, and release teams ensure integrity and trust in code deployment pipelines by identifying unsigned or improperly signed binaries

### 🔧 Architecture Overview

#### 📦 Backend (.NET 8):

* RESTful or gRPC APIs
* Runs a signature validation engine compatible with Windows Authenticode, macOS codesign, and GPG for Linux
* Performs:

  * Signature integrity check
  * Certificate chain validation
  * Timestamp authority check
  * Revocation status using OCSP/CRL
* Scans folders or full directories recursively
* Generates comprehensive reports in JSON, HTML, and CSV formats
* Schedules periodic background scans (optional)

#### 🖥️ Frontend (Electron UI):

* React or Vue-based UI using TypeScript
* Presents:

  * Dashboard with scanning stats
  * Filterable and sortable list of scanned files
  * Highlighted unsigned or expired-signed files
  * Signature metadata viewer (certificate issuer, validity, etc.)
* Can export reports or trigger remediation workflows
* Settings panel for:

  * Path inclusion/exclusion
  * Scan frequency
  * Certificate whitelisting/blacklisting

---

### 🚀 Key Features

#### ✅ Signature Validation

* Check digital signatures on:

  * EXE, DLL, SYS, MSI (Windows)
  * APP, PKG (macOS)
  * ELF, SO, SH (Linux)
* Detect:

  * Missing signatures
  * Invalid or tampered signatures
  * Expired certs or timestamping

#### 📊 Signature Reporting Dashboard

* Total files scanned
* Signed vs unsigned distribution
* Certificate issuers
* Expiry timelines
* Security level by code signing trust

#### 🧠 Language-Agnostic Integration

* Analyze signing for artifacts from C#, Java, Go, Rust, C++, etc.
* Accept plugins or scriptable extensions for other CI/CD ecosystems

#### 📂 File System Watcher

* Monitors paths and triggers scans on new or modified binaries

#### 🔒 Security Alerts & Telemetry

* Warn on:

  * Self-signed certs
  * Untrusted root CA
  * Missing timestamping
* Optional integrations:

  * Email notifications
  * Microsoft Defender/ATP or similar alerts

#### 🛠️ Extensibility

* Plugin-based architecture for signature engines
* JSON-based rules engine for flagging anomalies

#### 📡 API Server (Optional Mode)

* Can run as a REST/gRPC daemon for remote Electron clients

### 📤 Future Roadmap Ideas

* Integration with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline signing checks
* Integration with Azure Key Vault or AWS KMS for cert verification
* SBOM validation against signed files
* SBOM + CodeSign correlation report
* TUF (The Update Framework) integration

### 💻 Development Instructions

* Use `pnpm` or `yarn` for frontend dev
* Use `dotnet watch run` for backend
* Communicate between Electron and .NET via HTTP/gRPC
* Containerized dev environment via Docker (optional)
